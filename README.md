# Express API Project

Thiw weeks project was out first back end project. We were supposed to build our own API with Express by using RESTful endpoints.

## The problem

I thought this project was really interesting but I had some difficulties to understand everything. I watched the lectures several times and tried out a lot of diffrent approaches that didn't work out so I need to practise more. I also had a lot of problems with errors in the terminal in the beginning but managed to solve them with help from team mates and Stack Overflow.
